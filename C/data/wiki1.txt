<!-- The Internet and the WWW are different concepts – please do not muddle them in this article -->
The '''Internet''' is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s that use the standard [[Internet protocol suite]] (TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. It is an international ''network of networks'' that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government [[packet switching|packet switched]] networks, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked [[hypertext]] documents and [[Web application|applications]] of the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW), the [[information infrastructure|infrastructure]] to support email, and [[peer-to-peer]] networks for [[file sharing]] and [[VOIP|telephony]].

The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the [[United States government]] in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks.<ref>[http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_ipto.htm "IPTO -- Information Processing Techniques Office"], ''The Living Internet'', Bill Stewart (ed), January 2000.</ref> While this work, together with work in the United Kingdom and France, led to important precursor networks, they were not the Internet. There is no consensus on the exact date when the modern Internet came into being, but sometime in the early to mid-1980s is considered reasonable.<ref>[http://www.nethistory.info/History%20of%20the%20Internet/origins.html "So, who really did invent the Internet?"], Ian Peter, The Internet History Project, 2004. Retrieved 27 June 2014.</ref> From that point, the network experienced decades of sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, [[personal computer|personal]], and [[mobile device|mobile]] computers were connected to it.

The funding of a new U.S. [[National Science Foundation Network|backbone]] by the [[National Science Foundation]] in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial backbones, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks.<ref>[http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_summary.htm "Internet History -- One Page Summary"], ''The Living Internet'', Bill Stewart (ed), January 2000.</ref> Though the Internet has been widely used by [[academia]] since the [[1980s]], the [[commercialization]] of what was by the 1990s an international network resulted in its popularization and incorporation into virtually every aspect of modern human life. {{As of|2012|6}}, more than 2.4 billion people—over a third of the [[world population|world's human population]]—have used the services of the Internet; approximately 100 times more people than were using it in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treese.org/intindex/95-11.htm |title=The Open Market Internet Index |publisher=Treese.org |date=1995-11-11 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref><ref name="stats">{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|title=World Stats|date=June 30, 2012|work=Internet World Stats|publisher=Miniwatts Marketing Group}}</ref> Internet use grew rapidly in the West from the mid-1990s to early 2000s and from the late 1990s to present in the [[developing world]]. In 1994 only 3% of American classrooms had access to the Internet while by 2002 92% did.<ref>[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2007/2007020.pdf ''Internet Access in U.S. Public Schools and Classrooms: 1994–2005 Highlights''], National Center for Educational Statistics, U.S. Department of Education (NCES 2007-020), November 2006. Retrieved 22 January 2014.</ref>

Most traditional communications media including telephone, music, film, and television are being reshaped or redefined by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as [[voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) and [[Internet Protocol television]] (IPTV). Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to [[Web site|website]] technology, or are reshaped into [[blogging]] and [[web feed]]s. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of human interactions through [[instant messaging]], [[Internet forum]]s, and [[social network service|social networking]]. [[Online shopping]] has boomed both for major retail outlets and small [[artisan]]s and traders. [[Business-to-business]] and [[financial services]] on the Internet affect [[supply chain]]s across entire industries.

The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies.<ref>[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/who-owns-internet.htm "Who owns the Internet?"], Jonathan Strickland, ''How Stuff Works''. Retrieved 27 June 2014.</ref> Only the overreaching definitions of the two principal [[name space]]s in the Internet, the [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] space and the [[Domain Name System]], are directed by a maintainer organization, the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.<ref>"The Tao of IETF: A Novice's Guide to Internet Engineering Task Force", P.

{{See also|Capitalization of "Internet"}}
The ''Internet'', referring to the specific global system of interconnected [[Internet Protocol|IP]] networks, is a [[proper noun]] and written with an initial [[capital letter]]. In the media and common use it is often not capitalized, viz. ''the internet.'' Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not capitalized when used as a verb or an adjective.<ref>[http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/ch07/ch07_sec076.html?para= "7.76 Terms like 'web' and 'Internet'"], ''Chicago Manual of Style'', University of Chicago, 16th edition {{registration required}}</ref> The Internet is also often referred to as ''the Net''.

Historically the word ''internet'' was used, uncapitalized, as early as 1883 as a verb and adjective to refer to interconnected motions. Starting in the early 1970s the term ''internet'' was used as a shorthand form of the technical term [[internetwork]], the result of interconnecting computer networks with special gateways or routers. It was also used as a verb meaning to connect together, especially for networks.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title=Internet, n |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00304286 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |edition=Draft |date=March 2009 |quote=Shortened < INTERNETWORK n., perhaps influenced by similar words in -net}}</ref><ref>Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., gives nineteenth-century use and pre-Internet verb use</ref>

The terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'' are often used interchangeably in everyday speech; it is common to speak of "going on the Internet" when invoking a [[web browser]] to view [[web page]]s. However, the [[World Wide Web]] or ''the Web'' is just one of a very large number of [[Internet Services|services]] running on the Internet. The Web is a collection of interconnected documents (web pages) and other [[web resource]]s, linked by [[hyperlink]]s and [[uniform resource locator|URL]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#h-12.1|title= Links |accessdate=13 August 2008 |work=HTML 4.01 Specification |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |date=HTML 4.01 Specification | quote = [T]he link (or hyperlink, or Web link) [is] the basic hypertext construct.

All of these services can be implemented on any [[intranet]], accessible to network users.

The term ''[[wikt:interweb|Interweb]]'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'' typically used sarcastically to parody a technically unsavvy user.<ref>[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=interweb Interweb], Urban Dictionary</ref>

==Governance==
{{Main|Internet governance}}
[[File:Icannheadquarters.jpg|thumb|ICANN headquarters in [[Marina Del Rey]], California, United States.]]

The Internet is a [[global network|globally distributed network]] comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body.

The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.

To maintain interoperability, the principal [[name space]]s of the Internet are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), headquartered in [[Marina del Rey, California]]. ICANN is the authority that coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces, in which names and numbers are uniquely assigned, are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet. ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN's role in coordinating the assignment of unique identifiers distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet.<ref>Klein, Hans. (2004). [http://www.ip3.gatech.edu/research/KLEIN_ICANN%2BSovereignty.doc "ICANN and Non-Territorial Sovereignty: Government Without the Nation State."] Internet and Public Policy Project. Georgia Institute of Technology.</ref>

Allocation of IP addresses is delegated to [[Regional Internet Registry|Regional Internet Registries]] (RIRs):
*[[AfriNIC|African Network Information Center]] (AfriNIC) for Africa
*[[American Registry for Internet Numbers]] (ARIN) for North America
*[[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre]] (APNIC) for Asia and the Pacific region
*[[Latin American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry]] (LACNIC) for Latin America and the Caribbean region
*[[RIPE|Réseaux IP Européens - Network Coordination Centre]] (RIPE NCC) for Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia

The [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Commerce]], continues to have final approval over changes to the [[DNS root zone]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Packard |first= Ashley |title= Digital Media Law |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |year= 2010  |isbn= 978-1-4051-8169-3 |page= 65}}</ref><ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/01/bush_net_policy/ "Bush administration annexes internet"], Kieren McCarthy, The Register, 1 July 2005</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Mueller |first= Milton L. |title= Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2010  |isbn= 978-0-262-01459-5 |page= 61}}</ref>

The [[Internet Society]] (ISOC) was founded in 1992, with a mission to ''"assure the open development, evolution and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/isochistory.shtml |title=Internet Society (ISOC) All About The Internet: History of the Internet |publisher=ISOC |accessdate=2013-12-19}}</ref> Its members include individuals (anyone may join) as well as corporations, organizations, governments, and universities. Among other activities ISOC provides an administrative home for a number of less formally organized groups that are involved in developing and managing the Internet, including: the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), [[Internet Architecture Board]] (IAB), [[Internet Engineering Steering Group]] (IESG), [[Internet Research Task Force]] (IRTF), and [[Internet Research Steering Group]] (IRSG).

On 16 November 2005, the United Nations-sponsored [[World Summit on the Information Society]], held in [[Tunis]], established the [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) to discuss Internet-related issues.

==Infrastructure==
The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture.

===Routing and service tiers===
[[File:Internet Connectivity Distribution & Core.svg|400px|right|thumb|upright=2.5|Packet routing across the Internet is accomplished by several tiers of Internet service providers.]]

[[Internet service provider]]s connect customers, which represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy, to customers of other ISPs via other higher or same-tier networks. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the [[tier 1 network]]s, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via [[peering]] agreements. [[Tier 2 network|Tier 2]] and lower level networks buy [[Internet transit]] from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement [[multihoming]] to achieve redundancy and load balancing. [[Internet exchange point]]s are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs.

Computers and routers use [[routing table]]s in their operating system to [[IP forwarding|direct IP packets]] to the next-hop router or destination. Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by [[routing protocol]]s. End-nodes typically use a [[default route]] that points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet.

Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as [[GEANT]], [[GLORIAD]], [[Internet2]], and the UK's [[national research and education network]], [[JANET]].

It has been determined that both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of [[scale-free network]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=A. L. Barab´asi|first=R. Albert|title=Statistical mechanics of complex networks|journal=Rev. Mod. Phys.|year=2002|volume=74|pages=47–94

===Access===
Common methods of [[Internet access]] by users include dial-up with a computer [[modem]] via telephone circuits, [[Broadband Internet access|broadband]] over [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optic]] or copper wires, [[Wi-Fi]], [[Satellite Internet|satellite]] and [[mobile telephony|cellular telephone]] technology ([[3G]], [[4G]]). The Internet may often be accessed from computers in  libraries and [[Internet cafe]]s. [[Internet kiosk|Internet access points]] exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops. Various terms are used, such as ''public Internet kiosk'', ''public access terminal'', and ''Web [[payphone]]''. Many hotels also have public terminals, though these are usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usage, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or online payment. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via local computer networks. [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|Hotspots]] providing such access include [[Wi-Fi#Internet access|Wi-Fi cafes]], where users need to bring their own wireless-enabled devices such as a laptop or [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.

[[Grassroots]] efforts have led to [[wireless community network]]s. Commercial Wi-Fi services covering large city areas are in place in London, [[Vienna]], [[Toronto]], San Francisco, [[Philadelphia]], Chicago and [[Pittsburgh]]. The Internet can then be accessed from such places as a park bench.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pasternak |first=Sean B. |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000082&sid=aQ0ZfhMa4XGQ&refer=canada |title=Toronto Hydro to Install Wireless Network in Downtown Toronto |publisher=Bloomberg |date=7 March 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> Apart from Wi-Fi, there have been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like [[Ricochet (Internet service)|Ricochet]], various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks, and fixed wireless services. High-end mobile phones such as [[smartphone]]s in general come with Internet access through the phone network. Web browsers such as [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] are available on these advanced handsets, which can also run a wide variety of other Internet software. More mobile phones have Internet access than PCs, though this is not as widely used.<ref>"By 2013, mobile phones will overtake PCs as the most common Web access device worldwide", according a forecast in [http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1278413 "Gartner Highlights Key Predictions for IT Organizations and Users in 2010 and Beyond"], Gartner, Inc., 13 January 2010</ref> An Internet access provider and protocol matrix differentiates the methods used to get online.

==Protocols==
[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|right|300px|As user data is processed through the protocol stack, each abstraction layer adds encapsulation information at the sending host. Data is transmitted ''over the wire'' at the link level between hosts and routers. Encapsulation is removed by the receiving host.

{{IP stack}}
While the Internet's hardware can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software architecture that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/ |title=IETF Home Page |publisher=Ietf.org |accessdate=20 June 2009}}</ref> The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting discussions and standards are published in a series of publications, each called a [[Request for Comments]] (RFC), on the IETF web site.

The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the [[Internet Standard]]s. Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.

The Internet standards describe a framework known as the [[Internet protocol suite]]. This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols, originally documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123. The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the [[application layer]], the space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the [[client-server]] application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a [[peer-to-peer]] paradigm. Below this top layer, the [[transport layer]] connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods.

Underlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and hosts via the physical connections. The [[internet layer]] enables computers to identify and locate each other via [[IP address|Internet Protocol (IP) addresses]], and routes their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks. Last, at the bottom of the architecture is the [[link layer]], which provides connectivity between hosts on the same network link, such as a physical connection in form of a [[local area network]] (LAN) or a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]]. The model, also known as [[TCP/IP]], is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware, which the model therefore does not concern itself with in any detail. Other models have been developed, such as the [[Open Systems Interconnection]] (OSI) model, that attempt to be comprehensive in every aspect of communications. While many similarities exist between the models, they are not compatible in the details of description or implementation; indeed, TCP/IP protocols are usually included in the discussion of OSI networking.

The most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides addressing systems ([[IP address]]es) for computers on the Internet. IP enables internetworking and in essence establishes the Internet itself. [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) is the initial version used on the first generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ~4.3&nbsp;billion (10<sup>9</sup>) Internet hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], which entered its final stage in 2011,<ref>{{cite web | last=Huston | first=Geoff | title=IPv4 Address Report, daily generated | url=http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html | accessdate=20 May 2009}}</ref> when the global address allocation pool was exhausted.  A new protocol version, IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. [[IPv6]] is currently in growing [[IPv6 deployment|deployment]] around the world, since Internet address registries ([[Regional Internet registry|RIRs]]) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arin.net/knowledge/about_resources/ceo_letter.pdf |title=Notice of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Address Depletion |format=PDF |accessdate=7 August 2009}}</ref>

IPv6 is not directly interoperable by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. This means software upgrades or translator facilities are necessary for networking devices that need to communicate on both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, is still lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., [[peering agreement]]s, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe how to exchange data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.

==Services==
The Internet carries an extremely large number of [[network service]]s, including the [[World Wide Web]], [[electronic mail]], [[Internet telephony|Internet phone]], [[File sharing|audio, video and file transfer]] services.

===World Wide Web===
[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|right|This [[NeXT Computer]] was used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] and became the world's first [[Web server]].]]

Many people use the terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'', or just the ''Web'', interchangeably, but the two terms are not [[synonymous]]. The [[World Wide Web]] is only one of hundreds of services used on the Internet. The Web is a global set of [[documents]], [[Computer graphics|images]] and other resources, logically interrelated by [[hyperlink]]s and referenced with [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s (URIs). URIs symbolically identify services, [[web servers|servers]], and other databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web. [[Web service]]s also use HTTP to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data.

World Wide Web browser software, such as Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Google Chrome]], lets users navigate from one web page to another via hyperlinks embedded in the documents. These documents may also contain any combination of [[computer data]], including graphics, sounds, [[Plain text|text]], [[web video|video]], [[multimedia]] and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page. [[Client-side scripting|Client-side software]] can include animations, [[web game|games]], [[office applications]] and scientific demonstrations. Through [[keyword (Internet search)|keyword]]-driven [[Internet research]] using [[Web search engine|search engine]]s like [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo!]] and [[Google (search engine)|Google]], users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.

The Web has also enabled individuals and organizations to [[publish]] ideas and information to a potentially large [[audience]] online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial [[cost]] and many cost-free services are available. Publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition, however. Many individuals and some companies and groups use ''web logs'' or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage [[employees|staff]] to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.

One example of this practice is [[Microsoft]], whose [[software developer|product developers]] publish their personal blogs in order to pique the public's interest in their work.{{or|date=April 2014}} Collections of personal web pages published by large service providers remain popular, and have become increasingly sophisticated. Whereas operations such as [[Angelfire]] and [[GeoCities]] have existed since the early days of the Web, newer offerings from, for example, Facebook and Twitter currently have large followings. These operations often brand themselves as [[social network service]]s rather than simply as web page hosts.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

[[Online advertising|Advertising]] on popular web pages can be lucrative, and [[e-commerce]] or the sale of products and services directly via the Web continues to grow.

When the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in [[HTML]], complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating flexible design, layout, and content. Websites are often created using [[content management]] software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose, while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.

===Communication===
Email is an important communications service available on the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet. Pictures, documents and other files are sent as [[email attachment]]s. Emails can be [[Carbon copy|cc-ed]] to multiple [[email address]]es.

[[Internet telephony]] is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the Internet. [[VoIP]] stands for Voice-over-[[Internet Protocol]], referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with [[walkie-talkie]]-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as [[Cable modem|cable]] or [[ADSL]]. VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.

Voice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include [[emergency telephone number]] dialing and reliability. Currently, a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Older traditional phones with no "extra features" may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a [[uninterruptible power supply|backup power source]] for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include [[Ventrilo]] and [[Teamspeak]]. Modern video game consoles also offer VoIP chat features.

===Data transfer===
[[File sharing]] is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A [[computer file]] can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server for easy download by others. It can be put into a "shared location" or onto a [[file server]] for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of "[[Web mirror|mirror]]" servers or [[peer-to-peer]] networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user [[authentication]], the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by [[encryption]], and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed&nbsp;– usually fully encrypted&nbsp;– across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by [[digital signature]]s or by [[MD5]] or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.

[[Streaming media]] is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet "broadcasters" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical [[webcast]]s to on-demand popular multimedia services. [[Podcast]]ing is a variation on this theme, where&nbsp;– usually audio&nbsp;– material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a [[portable media player]] to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.

Digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth.  For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morrison |first=Geoff |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40241749/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets |title=What to know before buying a 'connected' TV&nbsp;– Technology & science&nbsp;– Tech and gadgets&nbsp;– Tech Holiday Guide |publisher=MSNBC |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref>

[[Webcam]]s are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the [[Panama Canal]], traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video [[chat rooms]] and [[video conferencing]] are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users. It uses a [[Adobe Flash|flash]]-based web player to stream and show video files. Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. YouTube claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/t/fact_sheet |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qyMMarNd |archivedate=4 July 2010|title=YouTube Fact Sheet|publisher=YouTube, LLC |accessdate=20 January 2009}}</ref>

==Social impact==
{{Main|Sociology of the Internet}}
The Internet has enabled entirely new forms of social interaction, activities, and organizing, thanks to its basic features such as widespread usability and access.

Overall Internet usage has seen tremendous growth. From 2000 to 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 394 million to 1.858 billion.<ref>[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics/ Internet users graphs], Market Information and Statistics, International Telecommunications Union</ref> By 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion [[Google]] searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/71940/google-earth-demonstrates-how-technology-benefits-ris-civil-society-govt |title=Google Earth demonstrates how technology benefits RI`s civil society, govt |publisher=Antara News |date=2011-05-26 |accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref>

The prevalent language for communication on the Internet has been English. This may be a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as the language's role as a [[lingua franca]]. Early computer systems were limited to the characters in the [[ASCII|American Standard Code for Information Interchange]] (ASCII), a subset of the [[Latin alphabet]].

After English (27%), the most requested languages on the [[World Wide Web]] are Chinese (25%), Spanish (8%), Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each), Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and Korean (2%).<ref name="NIUBL-IWS" /><!-- Note that the use of these copyright statistics is dependent on "giving due credit and establishing an active link back to www.internetworldstats.com", so please do not remove the citation above --> By region, 42% of the world's [[Internet users]] are based in Asia, 24% in Europe, 14% in North America, 10% in Latin America and the [[Caribbean]] taken together, 6% in Africa, 3% in the Middle East and 1% in Australia/Oceania.<ref name=inetstats>[http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm World Internet Usage Statistics News and Population Stats] updated for 30 June 2010.

However, some glitches such as ''[[mojibake]]'' (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain.

In an American study in 2005, the percentage of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead of the percentage of women, although this difference reversed in those under 30. Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more likely to be broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were more likely to use the Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking.<ref>How men and women use the Internet Pew Research Center 28 December 2005</ref>
More recent studies indicate that in 2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking sites, such as Facebook and Myspace, although the ratios varied with age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://business.rapleaf.com/company_press_2008_07_29.html |title=Rapleaf Study on Social Network Users}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> In addition, women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/178175272.html |title=Women Ahead Of Men In Online Tv, Dvr, Games, And Social Media. |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |date=1 May 2008 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> In terms of blogs, men were more likely to blog in the first place; among those who blog, men were more likely to have a professional blog, whereas women were more likely to have a personal blog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technorati.com/blogging/state-of-the-blogosphere/ |title=Technorati's State of the Blogosphere |publisher=Technorati |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref>

According to Euromonitor, by 2020 43.7% of the world's population will be users of the Internet. Splitting by country, in 2011 Iceland, Norway and the Netherlands had the highest Internet penetration by the number of users, with more than 90% of the population with access.

===Usage===
The Internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections. The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through [[mobile Internet device]]s. Mobile phones, [[datacard]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[cellular router]]s allow users to connect to the Internet [[wireless]]ly. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.

Educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from [[CBeebies]], through school and high-school revision guides and [[Virtual university|virtual universities]], to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [[Google Scholar]]. For [[distance education]], help with [[homework]] and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the [[World Wide Web]] in particular are important enablers of both [[Education|formal]] and [[informal education]]. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.<ref>Reips, U.-D. (2008). How Internet-mediated research changes science. In A. Barak (Ed.), [http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/psychology/social-psychology/psychological-aspects-cyberspace-theory-research-applications Psychological aspects of cyberspace: Theory, research, applications] (pp. 268-294).

The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills has made [[collaboration|collaborative]] work dramatically easier, with the help of [[collaborative software]]. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the [[free software movement]], which has produced, among other things, [[Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]]. Internet chat, whether using an [[IRC]] chat room, an [[instant messaging]] system, or a [[social networking]] website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day.  Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.

[[Content management]] systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and [[computer literacy]] spread.

The Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily, wherever they may be. They may do this with or without [[computer security]], i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can [[audit]] the books of a company based in another country, on a [[server (computing)|server]] situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private [[leased line]]s would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using [[cloud computing]], or open a [[Remote Desktop Protocol|remote desktop]] session into their office PC using a secure [[Virtual Private Network]] (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among [[system administrator]]s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Virtual Private Nightmare: VPN|url=http://librenix.com/?inode=5013|publisher=Librenix|accessdate=21 July 2010|date=4 August 2004}}</ref> because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.

===Social networking and entertainment===
{{see also|Social networking service#Social impact}}
Many people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to find out more about their interests. People use [[online chat|chat]], messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. The Internet has seen a growing number of [[Web desktop]]s, where users can access their files and settings via the Internet.

[[Social network service|Social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Myspace]] have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [[LinkedIn]] foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [[Flickr]] specialize in users' videos and photographs.

The Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining [[social experiment]]s such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much traffic. Today, many [[Internet forums]] have sections devoted to games and funny videos. Over 6&nbsp;million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas. The [[Internet pornography]] and [[online gambling]] industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites.<ref>[http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com/internet-pornography-statistics.html "Internet Pornography Statistics"], Jerry Ropelato, Top Ten Reviews, 2006</ref> Although many governments have attempted to restrict both industries' use of the Internet, in general this has failed to stop their widespread popularity.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/SmallBiz/story?id=4151592 "Do It Yourself! Amateur Porn Stars Make Bank"], Russell Goldman, ABC News, 22 January 2008</ref>

Another area of leisure activity on the Internet is [[multiplayer gaming]].<ref>[http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamingnews/a/trendsdecade.htm "Top Online Game Trends of the Decade"], Dave Spohn, About.com, 15 December 2009</ref> This form of recreation creates communities, where people of all ages and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from [[MMORPG]] to [[first-person shooter]]s, from [[role-playing video game]]s to [[online gambling]]. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as [[GameSpy Arcade|GameSpy]] and [[MPlayer.com|MPlayer]].<ref>[http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamingnews/a/timeline.htm "Internet Game Timeline: 1963&nbsp;– 2004"], Dave Spohn, About.com, 2 June 2011</ref> Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.

Internet usage has been correlated to users' loneliness.<ref>{{cite web|author=Carole Hughes, Boston College |url=https://www2.bc.edu/~hughesc/abstract.html |title=The Relationship Between Internet Use and Loneliness Among College Students |publisher=Boston College |accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref>  Lonely people tend to use the Internet as an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories with others, such as in the "[[I am lonely will anyone speak to me]]" thread.

[[Cybersectarianism]] is a new organizational form which involves: "highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader.  Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders.  Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in collective study via email, on-line chat rooms and web-based message boards."<ref>Patricia M. Thornton, "The New Cybersects: Resistance and Repression in the Reform era. " In Elizabeth Perry and Mark Selden, eds., ''Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance'' (second edition) (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 149–50.</ref>

[[Cyberslacking]] can become a drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spent 57 minutes a day surfing the Web while at work, according to a 2003 study by Peninsula Business Services.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/net-abuse-hits-small-city-firms-1-892163 |title=Net abuse hits small city firms |work=The Scotsman  |date= 11 September 2003|accessdate=7 August 2009 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref> [[Internet addiction disorder]] is excessive computer use that interferes with daily life. Psychologist Nicolas Carr believe that Internet use has other [[Psychological effects of Internet use|effects on individuals]], for instance improving skills of scan-reading and interfering with the deep thinking that leads to true creativity.<ref>[http://www.theshallowsbook.com/nicholascarr/Nicholas_Carrs_The_Shallows.html ''The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains''], Nicholas Carr, W.

===Electronic business===
{{Main|Electronic business}}
Electronic business (E-business) involves business processes spanning the entire [[value chain]]: electronic purchasing and [[supply chain management]], processing orders electronically, handling customer service, and cooperating with business partners. [[E-commerce]] seeks to add revenue streams using the Internet to build and enhance relationships with clients and partners.

According to research firm [[International Data Corporation|IDC]], the size of total worldwide e-commerce, when 
global business-to-business and -consumer transactions are added together,

While much has been written of the economic advantages of [[electronic commerce|Internet-enabled commerce]], there is also evidence that some aspects of the Internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce [[economic inequality]] and the [[digital divide]].<ref>{{cite web | title=How the Internet Reinforces Inequality in the Real World  | work=The Atlantic  | author=Badger, Emily |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-13 | url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/ }}</ref> Electronic commerce may be responsible for [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] and the decline of [[mom-and-pop]], [[brick and mortar]] businesses resulting in increases in [[income inequality]].<ref>[http://www.zdnet.com/e-commerce-will-make-the-shopping-mall-a-retail-wasteland-7000009960/ "E-commerce will make the shopping mall a retail wasteland"] ''ZDNet'', January 17, 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2012/12/Free_Shipping_Day_Promotion_Spurs_Late-Season_Online_Spending_Surge "‘Free Shipping Day’ Promotion Spurs Late-Season Online Spending Surge, Improving Season-to-Date Growth Rate to 16 Percent vs. Year Ago"] ''Comscore'', December 23, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/12/death-american-shopping-mall/4252/ "The Death of the American Shopping Mall"] ''The Atlantic — Cities'', December 26, 2012</ref>

===Telecommuting===
{{Main|Telecommuting}}
Remote work is facilitated by tools such as [[groupware]], [[virtual private networks]], [[conference calling]], [[videoconferencing]], and [[Voice over IP]] (VOIP). It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As [[broadband]] Internet connections become more commonplace, more and more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate [[intranet]] and internal phone networks.

===Crowdsourcing===
Internet provides a particularly good venue for [[crowdsourcing]] ([[outsourcing]] tasks to a distributed group of people) since individuals tend to be more open in web-based projects where they are not being physically judged or scrutinized and thus can feel more comfortable sharing.

Crowdsourcing systems are used to accomplish a variety of tasks. For example, the crowd may be invited to develop a new technology, carry out a design task, refine or carry out the steps of an algorithm (see [[human-based computation]]), or help capture, systematize, or analyze large amounts of data (see also [[citizen science]]).

[[Wiki]]s have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1142215.1142259|title=New Interfaces For Musical Expression|isbn=2-84426-314-3|author=MM Wanderley, D Birnbaum, J Malloch|year=2006|publisher=IRCAM&nbsp;– Centre Pompidou|page=180}}</ref> In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on [[grant writing]], [[strategic planning]], departmental documentation, and committee work.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Putting Wikis to Work in Libraries|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a901841555&db=all|author=Nancy T.

The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of [[Howard Dean]] in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet. Many political groups use the Internet to achieve a new method of organizing in order to carry out their mission, having given rise to [[Internet activism]], most notably practiced by rebels in the [[Arab Spring]].<ref name = cascading>{{cite web|url= http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/|title=The Arab Uprising's Cascading Effects|publisher=Miller-mccune.com|date=23 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2011/chokoshvili_davit.pdf The Role of the Internet in Democratic Transition: Case Study of the Arab Spring], Davit Chokoshvili, Master's Thesis, June 2011</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that [[social media]] websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, helped people organize the political revolutions in Egypt where it helped certain classes of protesters organize protests, communicate grievances, and disseminate information.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/10youth.html | work=The New York Times | first=David D. | last=Kirkpatrick | title=Wired and Shrewd, Young Egyptians Guide Revolt | date=9 February 2011}}</ref>

The potential of the Internet as a civic tool of communicative power was thoroughly explored by Simon R. B. Berdal in his thesis of 2004: {{quote|As the globally evolving Internet provides ever new access points to virtual discourse forums, it also promotes new civic relations and associations within which communicative power may flow and accumulate. Thus, traditionally ... national-embedded peripheries get entangled into greater, international peripheries, with stronger combined powers... The Internet, as a consequence, changes the topology of the "centre-periphery" model, by stimulating conventional peripheries to interlink into "super-periphery" structures, which enclose and "besiege" several centres at once.<ref name=simonBerdal2004>{{Cite journal

Berdal, therefore, extends the [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] notion of the [[Public sphere]] to the Internet, and underlines the inherent global and civic nature that interwoven Internet technologies provide. To limit the growing civic potential of the Internet, Berdal also notes how "self-protective measures" are put in place by those threatened by it: {{quote|If we consider China’s attempts to filter "unsuitable material" from the Internet, most of us would agree that this resembles a self-protective measure by the system against the growing civic potentials of the Internet. Nevertheless, both types represent limitations to "peripheral capacities". Thus, the Chinese government tries to prevent communicative power to build up and unleash (as the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Tiananmen Square uprising]] suggests, the government may find it wise to install "upstream measures"). Even though limited, the Internet is proving to be an empowering tool also to the Chinese periphery: Analysts believe that Internet petitions have influenced policy implementation in favour of the public’s online-articulated will ...<ref name=simonBerdal2004 />}}

In fairness, incidents of politically motivated [[internet censorship]] have now been recorded in many countries, including western democracies.

===Philanthropy===
The spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer]] charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals.  Websites, such as [[DonorsChoose]] and [[GlobalGiving]], allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice.

A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of [[peer-to-peer lending]] for charitable purposes. [[Kiva]] pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [[microfinance]] organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.<ref>[http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php ''Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems''], by David Roodman, Center for Global Development, 2 October 2009, as accessed  2 & 16 January 2010</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Strom|first=Stephanie|title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes|work=The New York Times|page=6|date=9 November 2009|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html}}</ref>

However, the recent spread of low cost Internet access in [[developing countries]] has made genuine international person-to-person  philanthropy increasingly feasible. In 2009 the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] tapped into this trend to offer the first person-to-person microfinance platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without intermediaries. Members can fund loans for as little as a dollar, which the borrowers then use to develop business activities that improve their families' incomes while repaying loans to the members with interest. Borrowers access the Internet via public cybercafes, donated laptops in village schools, and even smart phones, then create their own profile pages through which they share photos and information about themselves and their businesses. As they repay their loans, borrowers continue to share updates and dialogue with lenders via their profile pages. This direct web-based connection allows members themselves to take on many of the communication and recording tasks traditionally performed by local organizations, bypassing geographic barriers and dramatically reducing the cost of microfinance services to the entrepreneurs.<ref>[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ "Zidisha Set to "Expand" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}</ref>

===Surveillance===
{{main|Computer and network surveillance}}
{{See also |Signals intelligence|Mass surveillance}}
The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of [[data mining|data]] and [[traffic analysis|traffic]] on the Internet.<ref name="sciam-internet">{{cite news|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=internet-eavesdropping|title=Internet Eavesdropping: A Brave New World of Wiretapping |last=Diffie|first=Whitfield|author2=Susan Landau|date=August 2008|work=Scientific American|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> In the United States for example, under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], all phone calls and broadband internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies.<ref name="eff-calea-archive">{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html|title=CALEA Archive -- Electronic Frontier Foundation|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref><ref name="eff-calea-summary">{{cite web|url=http://www.eff.org/issues/calea|title=CALEA: The Perils of Wiretapping the Internet|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref><ref name="eff-calea-faq">{{cite web|url=http://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq|title=CALEA: Frequently Asked Questions|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>

[[Packet capture]] (also sometimes referred to as “packet sniffing”) is the monitoring of data traffic on a [[computer network]]. Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called "packets", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete "message" again. [[Packet Capture Appliance]] intercepts these packets as they are travelling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information ''gathering'' tool, but not an ''analysis'' tool. That is it gathers "messages" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform [[traffic analysis]] and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]] all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' [[broadband Internet]] and [[voice over Internet protocol]] (VoIP) traffic.<ref>[http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf American Council on Education vs. FCC], Decision, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 9 June 2006. Retrieved 8 September 2013.</ref>

There is far too much data gathered by these packet sniffers for human investigators to manually search through all of it. So automated Internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted Internet traffic, and filter out and report to human investigators those bits of information which are "interesting"—such as the use of certain words or phrases, visiting certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with a certain individual or group.<ref name="usatoday-chatroom">{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|title=Government funds chat room surveillance research|last=Hill|first=Michael|date=October 11, 2004|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> Billions of dollars per year are spent, by agencies such as the [[Information Awareness Office]], [[NSA]], and the [[FBI]], to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems which intercept and analyze all of this data, and extract only the information which is useful to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.<ref name="zdnet-fbi">{{cite news|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-151059.html|title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=January 30, 2007|work=ZDNet News|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>

Some governments, such as those of [[Burma]], [[Iran]], [[Censorship in North Korea|North Korea]], the [[Censorship in China|Mainland China]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] restrict what people in their countries can access on the Internet, especially political and religious content. This is accomplished through software that filters domains and content so that they may not be easily accessed or obtained without elaborate circumvention.<ref>[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=12187 ''Access Controlled: The Shaping of Power, Rights, and Rule in Cyberspace''], Ronald J. Deibert, John G. Palfrey, Rafal Rohozinski, and Jonathan Zittrain (eds), MIT Press, April 2010, ISBN 0-262-51435-4, ISBN 978-0-262-51435-4</ref>

In Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, major Internet service providers have voluntarily, possibly to avoid such an arrangement being turned into law, agreed to restrict access to sites listed by authorities. While this list of forbidden URLs is supposed to contain addresses of only known child pornography sites, the content of the list is secret.<ref name="The Register">{{cite web | title=Finland censors anti-censorship site | work=[[The Register]] | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/18/finnish_policy_censor_activist/ | date=18 February 2008 | accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> Many countries, including the United States, have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material, such as [[child pornography]], via the Internet, but do not mandate filtering software. There are many free and commercially available software programs, called [[content-control software]], with which a user can choose to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks, in order to limit a child's access to pornographic materials or depiction of violence.

==Performance==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
The Internet is heterogeneous; for instance, [[Bit rate|data transfer rate]]s and physical characteristics of connections vary widely, and exhibits [[Emergence|emergent phenomena]] that depend on its large-scale organization. For example, data transfer rates exhibit temporal [[self-similarity]].

===Outages===
An Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signaling interruptions. Disruptions of [[submarine communications cable]]s may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the [[2008 submarine cable disruption]].  Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links.  Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia.<ref>{{cite news|agency=The Guardian|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access|title=Georgian woman cuts off web access to whole of Armenia|date=6 April 2011|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref> Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of [[Internet censorship]], as in the blockage of the [[Internet in Egypt]], whereby approximately 93%<ref name="renesys1">{{cite web| last =Cowie| first =James| title =Egypt Leaves the Internet| publisher =[[Renesys]]| url =http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml | accessdate=28 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w51j0pga |archivedate=28 January 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|anti-government protests]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12306041 |work=BBC News | title=Egypt severs internet connection amid growing unrest |date=28 January 2011}}</ref>

=== Energy use ===

Attempts to quantify the energy used by the Internet have been made. In 2011 researchers estimated that the Internet consumed between 170 and 307 GW, less than 2 percent of the energy used by humanity. This estimate includes the energy needed to build, operate, and periodically replace the estimated 750 million laptops, a billion smart phones and 100 million servers worldwide as well as the energy that routers, cell towers, optical switches, Wi-Fi transmitters and cloud storage devices use when transmitting Internet traffic.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/10/307-gw-the-maximum-energy-the.html "Internet responsible for 2 per cent of global energy usage"], Jim Giles, ''New Scientist'' (Reed Business Information Ltd.), 26 October 2011.</ref><ref>[http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2011/papers/hotnetsX-final56.pdf "The Energy and Emergy of the Internet"], Barath Raghavan (ICSI) and Justin Ma (UC Berkeley), in ''Proceedings of the 10th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks'', November 14–15, 2011, Cambridge, MA, USA.
